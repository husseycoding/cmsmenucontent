CMS Menu Content
================
Adds tab style content switching to Magento CMS pages.

Description
-----------
This fully search engine optimised (SEO) extension allows you to greatly condense the number of CMS pages you need by quickly and easily including any number of static blocks on a CMS page with customisable links to switch between block content.

This allows you to have a high volume of information on only a few pages while keeping content highly readable and accessible by the customer.

Usage
-----
The extension adds configuration settings under a new tab when editing a CMS page and also under a new section when editing a static block. The menu can be added anywhere on a CMS page just by including the {{menucontent}} tag in the page content.

Support
-------
If you have any problems with this extension, open an issue on GitHub.
